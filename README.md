**Neurolens AI**

Neurolens AI is an artificial intelligence system designed to assist in the early detection of cognitive decline, including conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). It analyzes written language to identify subtle markers of neurodegeneration.

Neurolens AI uses a large language model (LLM) backend to process journal entries, emails, messages, or other text samples, looking for patterns linked to cognitive changes. These patterns may include simplified grammar, shorter sentences, word-finding difficulties, repetition, and loss of coherence.

**Features**

- Analyzes natural written text for markers of cognitive decline

- Identifies features such as repetition, reduced vocabulary richness, and disorganized phrasing

- Provides a gentle, explainable risk summary

- Tracks trends over time to support early intervention

- Built using modern web technologies and OpenAI’s API

**How it works**
1. The user submits text samples (e.g. journal entries, emails, or transcribed speech).

2. The AI analyzes the language for linguistic markers associated with neurodegenerative disease.

3. A summary is generated, highlighting potential concerns and encouraging follow-up if necessary.

4. Results can be tracked over time to monitor changes.

**Technologies**

- HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript

- OpenAI API (LLM backend)

- Modular front-end + back-end architecture

**Disclaimer**

Neurolens AI is a prototype research tool designed to explore the potential of artificial intelligence in analyzing written language for early markers of cognitive decline, including Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

**This tool is not a diagnostic device.** The information and output provided by Neurolens AI are intended solely for educational, research, and exploratory purposes. It should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Users are strongly encouraged to consult qualified healthcare providers regarding any concerns about cognitive health. Never disregard or delay seeking professional medical advice because of information generated by Neurolens AI.

Furthermore, Neurolens AI does not store, transmit, or share user text input beyond the scope of its immediate processing, but users should avoid submitting personally identifiable or sensitive medical information.

By using Neurolens AI, users acknowledge these limitations and agree to use the tool responsibly.

**Future improvements**
- Incorporate more detailed risk scoring and visualizations

- Fine-tune LLM on clinical datasets

- Add support for multilingual input

- Expand to spoken language input (speech-to-text integration)
