# neuroLensAI
Neurolens AI uses large language models (LLMs) to analyze everyday text — like emails, journal entries, or messages — for subtle linguistic markers linked to conditions like Alzheimer’s and mild cognitive impairment. It flags potential concerns and tracks trends over time, helping users and clinicians take action early.
