**Neurolens AI**
Neurolens AI is an artificial intelligence system designed to assist in the early detection of cognitive decline, including conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). It analyzes written language to identify subtle markers of neurodegeneration.

Neurolens AI uses a large language model (LLM) backend to process journal entries, emails, messages, or other text samples, looking for patterns linked to cognitive changes. These patterns may include simplified grammar, shorter sentences, word-finding difficulties, repetition, and loss of coherence.

**Features**
Analyzes natural written text for markers of cognitive decline

Identifies features such as repetition, reduced vocabulary richness, and disorganized phrasing

Provides a gentle, explainable risk summary

Tracks trends over time to support early intervention

Built using modern web technologies and OpenAI’s API

**How it works**
1. The user submits text samples (e.g. journal entries, emails, or transcribed speech).

2. The AI analyzes the language for linguistic markers associated with neurodegenerative disease.

3. A summary is generated, highlighting potential concerns and encouraging follow-up if necessary.

4. Results can be tracked over time to monitor changes.

**Example input**
Today I went to the, um, store and bought, uh, things, I can’t, well, you know, the things we need. Then I saw my, um, friend, the nice man, I forget his name, from next door. We talked about the, the, you know, the usual. I went home and, uh, watched the show, the one I like. The show with the, uh, lady. I forget the name now. It was good. Or maybe not today. Was it yesterday?

**Technologies**
HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript

OpenAI API (LLM backend)

Modular front-end + back-end architecture

Neurolens AI is a prototype designed for educational and research purposes. It is not intended for medical diagnosis or as a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Future improvements**
- Incorporate more detailed risk scoring and visualizations

- Fine-tune LLM on clinical datasets

- Add support for multilingual input

- Expand to spoken language input (speech-to-text integration)
